      <h1>What we do</h1>
    <p>Wiesel’s repetition of “Never shall I forget” creates a rhythmic, almost incantatory effect, emphasizing the inescapability of his trauma. By describing his life as “one long night,” he suggests that his suffering did not end with that moment but instead became a defining, permanent condition. The phrase “seven times cursed and seven times sealed” alludes to biblical and mystical numerology, reinforcing the idea that his fate is both tragic and unchangeable. Through these literary choices, Wiesel conveys not just his personal devastation but the irreversible spiritual and emotional toll of the Holocaust.</p>
